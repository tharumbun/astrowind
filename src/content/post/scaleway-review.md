This month, I discovered this French web hosting company while I was trying to find out more about the use of ARM processors for VPS. I am always interested in low-powered technology that is designed to fit the solution.

How about a powerful 64-bit ARM virtual machine for hosting WordPress or Ghost blogs? Things are getting more interesting.
