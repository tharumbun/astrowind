WordPress is one of the most popular content management systems (CMS) used by bloggers, businesses, and website owners. It is easy to use, customizable, and offers a range of features that make it a top choice for website creation. Many students also use WordPress to build personal blogs or websites for their school projects. However, hosting a WordPress website can be expensive, especially for students who are on a tight budget. Fortunately, there are several hosting programs that offer affordable WordPress hosting plans for students.

kokitree is excited to launch a new free WordPress hosting program aimed at university students, faculty members, and academic organizations. The program has started as an initiative to provide free and budget hosting for Cambodia’s bloggers who have been using our hosting services for their personal projects.

The free WordPress hosting program aimed at the two main target audiences — the educators and the individual students.

The main new thing in the kokitree students hosting program though is that individual students can now participate as well. Each student can get a one year full-featured hosting account by kokitree at a highly-discounted price. The only requirement is to provide a valid e-mail with the .edu extension.

Another addition to the program is the opportunity for student organizations to partner with kokitree and receive free hosting for their WordPress websites.
