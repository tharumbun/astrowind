**Cloudflare Domain Name: Reliable and Feature-Packed Registrar**

[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/), widely known for its content delivery network (CDN) and security services, also offers domain registration services. In this review, we'll explore the features, reliability, and overall experience of using Cloudflare as a domain name registrar.

User-Friendly Interface:
Cloudflare's domain management interface is intuitive and user-friendly. Registering a domain, managing DNS settings, and accessing additional features are all easily navigable. The clean layout and logical organization make it simple for both beginners and experienced users to manage their domains efficiently.

Competitive Pricing:
Cloudflare offers domain registrations at competitive prices, often with no hidden fees or additional charges. Domain renewals and transfers are also reasonably priced, making it an affordable choice for individuals and businesses alike. Moreover, Cloudflare offers transparent pricing with no upsells or aggressive marketing tactics.

Wide Range of Domain Extensions:
Cloudflare provides an extensive selection of domain extensions, including popular options like .com, .org, and .net, as well as country-specific extensions and newer generic top-level domains (gTLDs). Whether you need a traditional domain or want to explore more unique options, Cloudflare has you covered.

Security and Privacy Features:
As a security-focused company, Cloudflare incorporates robust security features into their domain registration service. They offer free DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) to enhance the security of DNS records. Additionally, Cloudflare's privacy protection service helps protect your personal information by masking your contact details in the WHOIS database.

Fast and Reliable DNS:
Cloudflare's global network infrastructure ensures fast and reliable DNS resolution for your domains. Leveraging their extensive CDN, DNS queries are handled quickly, resulting in improved website performance and availability. This is especially beneficial for businesses that rely on consistent online presence.

DNS Management and Integration:
Cloudflare's domain registration seamlessly integrates with their DNS management services. The DNS management interface is robust, allowing you to easily configure DNS records, set up subdomains, and manage various DNS-related settings. Cloudflare's Anycast network ensures DNS updates propagate quickly, minimizing any potential downtime.

Customer Support:
Cloudflare offers reliable customer support through various channels, including a comprehensive knowledge base, community forums, and ticket-based assistance. While phone support is not available for domain-related issues, the provided resources are generally sufficient to address common queries and concerns.

**Why you might consider using Cloudflare Domain Name Registrar**

* **No markups:** Cloudflare does not mark up the price of domain names. This means that you pay the same price that the registry charges, plus a small fee for Cloudflare's services. For example, the price of a .com domain name is currently $12.99 per year. If you register a .com domain name through Cloudflare, you will pay $12.99 plus a small fee for Cloudflare's services. This is significantly cheaper than the markups that many other domain name registrars charge.
  
* **Free DNSSEC:** DNSSEC is a security protocol that helps to protect your domain from DNS spoofing and hijacking. DNS spoofing is a type of attack where an attacker tries to trick your computer into using a fake DNS server. This can allow the attacker to redirect your traffic to a malicious website. DNS hijacking is a type of attack where an attacker takes control of your domain's DNS records. This can allow the attacker to change the IP address of your website, which can make it impossible for your visitors to access your website. Cloudflare offers free DNSSEC for all domains registered with its registrar. This means that your domain is protected from DNS spoofing and hijacking without you having to pay anything extra.

* **Easy to use:** Cloudflare's domain registrar is easy to use. You can register a new domain in just a few minutes, and you can manage your existing domains from the same dashboard. To register a new domain, simply visit the Cloudflare website and click on the "Register a Domain" button. You will be prompted to enter the domain name that you want to register. Once you have entered the domain name, you will be able to select the term (number of years) that you want to register the domain for. You will also be able to choose a plan. Cloudflare offers three plans: Free, Pro, and Enterprise. The Free plan is free to use and includes basic features. The Pro plan costs $20 per month and includes additional features, such as custom domain protection and email forwarding. The Enterprise plan is available for custom pricing and includes all of the features of the Pro plan, plus additional features, such as dedicated support and custom DNS.

* **Secure:** Cloudflare is a trusted security company, and its domain registrar is no exception. Your domain is protected by Cloudflare's industry-leading security features, including DDoS protection, malware scanning, and more. DDoS protection is a type of protection that helps to protect your website from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. A DDoS attack is an attack where an attacker tries to overwhelm your website with traffic. This can make it impossible for your visitors to access your website. Malware scanning is a type of protection that helps to protect your website from malware. Malware is software that is designed to harm your computer. Cloudflare's malware scanner scans all of the traffic that is sent to your website for malware. If Cloudflare's malware scanner finds malware, it will block the malware from reaching your website.

According to AskEustache, Cloudflare is a good domain registrar if you will use other Cloudflare services. The domains are affordable and renew at the same price. You get security features such as DNSSEC, two-factors, and privacy features.

**Cloudflare Registrar** offers the same service as other registrars for most users. The only difference is in price. Cloudflare Registrar includes security features such as DNSSEC and two-factor authentication for free.

If you are already using Cloudflare, there is no reason not to pay them for the domain as well. It's all in one place/interface.

Conclusion:
Cloudflare is a great option for anyone looking to register a domain name. It's affordable, secure, and easy to use.

Cloudflare Domain Name registration is a reliable and feature-packed service that combines user-friendly management tools, competitive pricing, strong security measures, and fast DNS resolution. Whether you're a small business, a tech enthusiast, or an individual looking for a dependable domain registrar, Cloudflare delivers a solid domain registration experience backed by their reputable infrastructure and commitment to security.
