Arc is a new web browser that was recently released for macOS. It is designed to be a more efficient and productive way to browse the web. Arc has a number of unique features that set it apart from other browsers, including:

* **A unique tab management system:** Arc's tab management system is designed to be more efficient and productive. All of your tabs are displayed on the left side of the screen, which frees up more space for your web pages. You can also group and pin tabs, and Arc will automatically save your open tabs when you close the browser.
