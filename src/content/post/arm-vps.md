An ARM VPS is a virtual private server that uses an ARM processor. ARM processors are typically found in mobile devices and embedded systems, but they are becoming increasingly popular for use in VPSs. ARM VPSs offer a number of advantages over traditional x86 VPSs, including:

- Lower power consumption
- Smaller form factor
- Longer battery life
- Improved performance per watt
- Increased security

ARM VPSs are a good choice for a variety of applications, including:

- Web hosting
- Content delivery networks (CDNs)
- Edge computing
- Internet of Things (IoT) devices
- Machine learning
- Artificial intelligence

Some of the providers of ARM VPSs include:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Microsoft Azure
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI): [check this Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Free Tier](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/FreeTier/freetier.htm)
- Hetzner Online
- OVHcloud
- [Scaleway](https://kokitree.com/posts/scaleway-review/) (AMP2 Instances)

### Hetzner Cloud server

[Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/news/arm64-cloud) has recently released four new server plans that are based on innovative Arm technology. These new plans offer up to 16 vCPUs based on Ampere® Altra® processors, which are extremely efficient and powerful.

The new Arm64 Cloud instances offer more options and flexibility than the previous Intel and AMD-based plans, and they also offer an amazing price-to-performance ratio.

### Google Cloud's Tau T2A

Google Cloud has introduced the Tau T2A machine series, the first Arm-based series on Compute Engine. Arm architecture is optimized for power efficiency, which results in better price-performance for the Tau T2A machine series.

Arm processors are becoming increasingly common in standard servers because they are more power-efficient than x86 servers. Mobile phones and laptops are examples of devices that use Arm processors. Arm CPUs have a reduced instruction set, which means that they can perform more instructions per second with less power consumption.

Here are some of the benefits of using Tau T2A machine series:

Lower power consumption: Arm processors are more power-efficient than x86 processors, which can lead to significant cost savings on your cloud bill. Increased performance: Arm processors can perform more instructions per second than x86 processors, which can lead to improved application performance.

Greater scalability: Arm processors are scalable, which means that you can easily add more resources to your Tau T2A machine series as your needs grow.

### AWS Graviton

AWS Graviton is a line of Arm-based processors designed by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The first generation of Graviton processors was released in late 2018, and the company has released a new generation of Graviton processors nearly every year since.

Graviton processors are designed to be more cost-effective, energy-efficient, and cloud-native-friendly than traditional x86 processors. They are used in a variety of AWS services, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

### Ampere Computing: Altra and Altra Max processors

Ampere Computing is a semiconductor company that designs and manufactures Arm-based server processors. The company was founded in 2018 and its first products, the Ampere Altra and Altra Max processors, were released in 2019.

Ampere's primary customers are the public cloud hyperscalers, such as Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Cloud, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud Services, and Tencent Cloud. These companies offer Ampere-based instance types, which are virtual machines that are powered by Ampere processors.

In 2020, Ampere had no presence in the public cloud. However, the company's market share has grown rapidly in recent years. According to Liftr Insights, Ampere now accounts for nearly 2% of public cloud instance types.

Microsoft Azure is the largest customer of Ampere Computing. The company offers the most Ampere-based instance types, accounting for more than 69% of Ampere-based instances. Alibaba Cloud, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud Services, and Tencent Cloud also offer Ampere-based instance types.

Ampere Computing is the only vendor that has found success delivering Arm-based processors into the server market. The company's success is due to a number of factors, including its focus on the public cloud market, its competitive pricing, and its high performance and efficiency.

When choosing an ARM VPS provider, it is important to consider the following factors:

- The type of ARM processor
- The amount of RAM
- The amount of storage
- The network bandwidth
- The price

ARM VPSs are a good option for businesses that are looking for a cost-effective and energy-efficient way to host their applications. They are also a good choice for businesses that need to deploy applications in remote or edge locations.
