11ty (also known as eleventy) is a static site generator that is designed to be simple and powerful. It is written in JavaScript and uses a template language called Nunjucks. [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) is a great option for developers who want to create static websites without the hassle of a traditional CMS.

11ty is a great framework for creating blogs. It is a simplified take on static site generators and gives you the basic tools that you need to create a blog. It does not force you to use any particular templating language, so you can still use Liquid if you want to port a Jekyll site over to 11ty. It is also completely secure and has lightning-fast page loads. However, it does not have a WYSIWYG editor.

### 11ty vs Astro

11ty and [Astro](https://astro.build/) are both static site generators, but they have different strengths and weaknesses.

11ty is a more flexible tool, but it can be more difficult to learn. It supports a variety of templating languages, including Markdown, Handlebars, and Liquid. It also has a large plugin ecosystem, which allows you to add additional features to your site.

Astro is a more opinionated tool, but it is easier to learn. It uses React as its templating language, and it has a built-in router and image optimizer. This makes it a good choice for building fast and efficient static websites.

Here is a table comparing the two tools:

| Feature | 11ty | Astro |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Template language | Markdown, Handlebars, Liquid | React |
| Router | N/A | Built-in |
| Image optimizer | N/A | Built-in |
| Plugin ecosystem | Large | Small |
| Learning curve | Steep | Gentle |
| Best for | Sites that need to be highly flexible or sites that need to be built quickly | Sites that need to be fast and efficient |

Ultimately, the best tool for you will depend on your specific needs. If you need a flexible tool that can be used to build a variety of static websites, then 11ty is a good choice. If you need a tool that is easy to learn and can be used to build fast and efficient static websites, then Astro is a good choice.
