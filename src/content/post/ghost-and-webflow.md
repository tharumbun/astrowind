Ghost and Webflow are two popular website building platforms. They both have their own strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to choose the right one for your needs.

### Ghost

Ghost is a headless CMS, which means that it's designed to be used with a separate front-end framework. This makes it a good choice for developers who want more control over the look and feel of their website. Ghost is also known for its speed and security.

### Webflow

Webflow is a drag-and-drop website builder that's designed for non-technical users. It's a good choice for anyone who wants to create a beautiful website without having to learn how to code. Webflow also offers a wide range of features, including e-commerce, membership sites, and marketing tools.
