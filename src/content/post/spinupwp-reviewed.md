If you’ve got a few WordPress blogs, it’s still easy to maintain and manage. Yet, with a dozen more, a simplified solution to do this well is a good, long term strategy. This is ideal for most people and agencies who manage WordPress websites for their clients.

## A hosting control panel dedicated to WordPress?

In this post, I’m going to review [Spinupwp](https://spinupwp.com/?referral=x3pL4A0542), one of the best cloud-based server control panels available. I’ve been using this for over a year. Spinupwp is a WordPress site management platform run by Delicious Brains Inc, a small company of expert WordPress developers. Who’s Delicious Brains Inc, you may ask. They have a good reputation of providing popular WP Migrate DB Pro and WP Offload Media plugins, and Advanced Custom Fields plugin.

After some days of research, I found Spinupwp as one of the best choices when comparing with Runcloud, Cloudways, and Gridpane. Actually, there are some more: ServerPilot, Laravel Forge, and EasyEngine to compare side by side.

Previously, I experimented with EasyEngine, which is great enough. If you like using a command line interface, then EasyEngine is a good option.

Although being a smaller, newer in this market (launched out of beta in 2019), I find Spinupwp great for many reasons. I’m going to share the key points here in this review.

Let’s look into the features. First thing first, Spinupwp supports most of the cloud servers or virtual private servers: Linode, Vultr, DigitalOcean, AWS (or even Lightsail).

SpinupWP is a cloud-based software application that offers users an efficient, user-friendly, and cost-effective way to manage their WordPress websites.

### Getting the best-optimized configuration for your WordPress site?

Running your WordPress blogs on the latest and best-configured software is essential. With the latest stable versions of Nginx, PHP, MySQL/MariaDB, and Redis, your WordPress sites are a great advantage in terms of performance and security. Redis object caching is the best to reduce database requests. You can easily enable full-page caching to serve pages ultra-fast without even hitting PHP. In addition to speed, you also need your all of your plenty WordPress sites safe and secure.

Among all of the Spinupwp features I like and use the most is Site Cloning. Moving sites from one VPS to another is easy and time-saving.

**Prices** You can easily start with its Personal option. You can upgrade to Team at any time.

**Pros**

> If time is your asset, having Spinupwp as your cloud control panel for many of your WordPress sites is the way to go. It's easy to use and manage. The web dashboard gives you full control of your deployed sites.

**Cons**

> It's not cheap (but affordable) It may not provide you all the features you want (despite many important ones are in the pipeline)

### How to use Spinupwp?

Spinning up a new WordPress is really quick and easy. After getting a new domain name, you need to add it to your VPS and update the Name Server on your domain name registra. Once propagated, you can start spinning up your new WordPress site.

All in all, Spinupwp allows you to quickly get WordPress websites up and running, while giving your web tech team the freedom to make server-level changes when necessary. I really like the service solution and recommend it to any developer or agency who wants to take their WordPress hosting service to a whole new level.

Good to know:

When you deploy a new VPS, you should opt to have the IP v4 as you'll need to use it when you spin up a new server on Spinupwp.
