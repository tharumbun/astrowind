A lightweight WordPress theme is one of the most important factors in determining the speed of your website. In this list, I will outline some of the most lightweight and fastest themes for WordPress blogs and websites. These themes come with high-quality code to speed up your WordPress site. They are free to download and use.

However, I must warn you that using too many plugins can also slow down your site. Even a lightweight theme on a powerful web server will not help much if you have too many plugins. Therefore, a minimalist WordPress theme is just one of several factors that define your site speed.

Why should you read my recommendations? Well, I have tested so many WordPress themes over the past decade. I am obsessed with blog speed.

**Arke** Arke is a truly minimal WordPress theme. No sidebars, no widgets, no settings. Just your content. The size of this theme is the smallest of all reviewed here.

**Twenty Twenty-Two (the WordPress team)** It's really hard to include the official WordPress theme. Every year, WordPress releases a new official theme. 2022 is no different.
