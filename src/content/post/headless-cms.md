A headless CMS is decoupled from the frontend of your website, which is what makes it static. The headless CMS is responsible for storing and managing your content, while the frontend of your website is responsible for displaying that content.

There are a number of benefits to using a headless CMS for your static site generator website. First, it allows you to decouple your content from your presentation, which makes it easier to update your content without having to update your frontend. Second, it allows you to use different frontend frameworks and technologies, which gives you more flexibility in how you build your website. Third, it can help you improve the performance of your website, as static pages are typically much faster than dynamic pages.

If you are looking for a CMS for your static site generator website, I recommend that you consider using a headless CMS.

There are a number of simple CMSs for static site generator websites. Some of the most popular include:

* **Statico** is a simple, lightweight CMS that is easy to use and customize. It is compatible with a variety of static site generators, including Jekyll, Hugo, and Eleventy.

* **StaticJsCMS** is a git-based CMS that allows you to manage your content from a single location. It is compatible with a variety of static site generators, including Jekyll, Hugo, and Eleventy.

* **Siteleaf** is a more robust CMS that offers a wider range of features, such as user management, multi-lingual support, and e-commerce integration. It is compatible with Jekyll, and can be used with other static site generators through its headless API.

* **Directus**

When choosing a CMS for your static site generator website, it is important to consider your needs and requirements. If you are looking for a simple, lightweight CMS that is easy to use, then Statico or StaticJsCMS may be a good option. If you need a more robust CMS with a wider range of features, then Siteleaf or Sanity.io may be a better choice.

Here are some additional factors to consider when choosing a CMS for your static site generator website:

* **Ease of use:** How easy is it to use the CMS? Does it have a user-friendly interface?
* **Features:** What features are important to you? Do you need user management, multi-lingual support, or e-commerce integration?
* **Compatibility:** Is the CMS compatible with the static site generator you are using?
* **Cost:** How much does the CMS cost? Are there any free or open source options available?
