A headless CMS is decoupled from the frontend of your website, which is what makes it static. The headless CMS is responsible for storing and managing your content, while the frontend of your website is responsible for displaying that content.

There are a number of benefits to using a headless CMS for your static site generator website. First, it allows you to decouple your content from your presentation, which makes it easier to update your content without having to update your frontend. Second, it allows you to use different frontend frameworks and technologies, which gives you more flexibility in how you build your website. Third, it can help you improve the performance of your website, as static pages are typically much faster than dynamic pages.

A headless CMS (Content Management System) is a backend-only content management system that focuses solely on content creation, management, and distribution. Unlike traditional CMS platforms, a headless CMS does not have a built-in frontend presentation layer. Instead, it provides content via an API (Application Programming Interface), allowing developers to deliver content to multiple frontend channels such as websites, mobile apps, smart devices, and more.

The term "headless" refers to the decoupling of the content management backend (the "head") from the frontend presentation layer (the "body"). This decoupling enables greater flexibility and agility in delivering content across various platforms and devices.

If you are looking for a CMS for your static site generator website, I recommend that you consider using a headless CMS.

There are a number of simple CMSs for static site generator websites. Some of the most popular include:

* **TinaCMS** (formerly Forestry.io) is a headless CMS that is backed by Git. This means that Tina's content is stored in a Git repository, which allows developers and content creators to collaborate seamlessly. [Tina](https://tina.io/) also provides a custom visual editing experience that is perfectly tailored to your site..

* **Static CMS** is a git-based CMS that allows you to manage your content from a single location. It is compatible with a variety of static site generators, including Jekyll, Hugo, and Eleventy.

* **Siteleaf** is a more robust CMS that offers a wider range of features, such as user management, multi-lingual support, and e-commerce integration. It is compatible with Jekyll, and can be used with other static site generators through its headless API.

* **Sanity.io** is a cloud-based CMS that offers a wide range of features and integrations. It is compatible with a variety of static site generators, including Jekyll, Hugo, and Eleventy.

* **Contentful**
* **Prismic**
* **GraphCMS**

When choosing a CMS for your static site generator website, it is important to consider your needs and requirements. If you are looking for a simple, lightweight CMS that is easy to use, then Statico or StaticJsCMS may be a good option. If you need a more robust CMS with a wider range of features, then Siteleaf or Sanity.io may be a better choice.

Here are some additional factors to consider when choosing a CMS for your static site generator website:

* **Ease of use:** How easy is it to use the CMS? Does it have a user-friendly interface?
* **Features:** What features are important to you? Do you need user management, multi-lingual support, or e-commerce integration?
* **Compatibility:** Is the CMS compatible with the static site generator you are using?
* **Cost:** How much does the CMS cost? Are there any free or open source options available?

Here are a few key characteristics and benefits of a headless CMS:

Content-as-a-Service (CaaS): A headless CMS provides content as a service, making content available through APIs in a structured format. This allows developers to fetch and display content dynamically, tailored to different frontend experiences and devices.

Flexibility and Omnichannel Content Delivery: With a headless CMS, content can be easily distributed across multiple channels, including websites, mobile apps, IoT devices, chatbots, and more. Developers have the freedom to choose the most suitable frontend technologies and frameworks for each channel without being tied to the limitations of a traditional CMS.

Improved Developer Experience: Headless CMS platforms are often developer-friendly, offering robust APIs and developer tools. Developers can work with their preferred programming languages, frameworks, and tools to build customized frontend experiences while leveraging the CMS for content management.

Faster Time to Market: The separation of backend and frontend development allows for parallel workstreams. Developers can focus on frontend development while content creators and managers can work on creating and organizing content. This separation can speed up the development process and enable quicker deployment of new features and content updates.

Scalability and Performance: Headless CMS architectures are inherently scalable, as they can handle large amounts of traffic and content distribution across multiple channels. By decoupling the frontend and backend, the system can be optimized for performance and scalability based on specific requirements.

Future-Proof and Technology Agnostic: As technology evolves, a headless CMS provides flexibility to adapt and integrate with new tools and platforms without significant system changes. It allows for easier upgrades and future enhancements, ensuring that the content management system remains compatible with emerging technologies.

It's important to note that while headless CMS offers flexibility and advantages in certain scenarios, it may require additional development resources and technical expertise compared to traditional CMS solutions. It's crucial to assess your specific project requirements, technical capabilities, and long-term goals before deciding if a headless CMS is the right fit for your needs.
